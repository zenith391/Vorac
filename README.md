# Vorac
Vorac is a build toolset for V applications.

It is based on a `Voracer` JSON file which specify build directory, source directory alongside preferred compiler or and supported V versions.
## Utility
That project is just made for testing out V and won't serve to most people, however, it can replace
```
v -o binary .
```
by
```
vorac
```
Which is a gain of 8 characters (depending on binary name length) xD
